"Monjid" in Arabic means supporter or saver in English, which means that our application is the saver for anyone looking for a car rent or wants to rent his/her own car in an effective and easy way.

"Monjid" is a simple andriod application developed using java and aims to help users to rent their desire car using their mobile, also will allow them to rent their unused car.

NOTE: The code is not suited for production and was developed as a college group assignment project, credits to my group members: Nourah Almaziad (@nourahmaziad), Lujain Almansour (@Lujain-M02) and Hend Alshaya (@hendjsh).
